# Bottoms Up - Workshop 1

## Goals/Emphasis
* @IBOutlet/IBAction
* Building interface in interface builder
* Basic Swift coding style 
* Intro to auto layout 

## Stretches
* Improve the UI 
Remove the box around the text field
Change the colors of fonts, buttons, backgrounds
Change the font of the text 
* Change type of keyboard (e.g. a numbers only keyboard) that appears when user taps in the text field
* Dismiss the keyboard when a user taps out of the text field 
* Create tests to ensure the user has typed something “valid” (e.g. test for non-numbers and let the user know they need to input a valid age) **coding heavy
* Change the minimum drinking age based on if the user is in the US or not in the US 
Hint: you can use a button or, if you really want to jump into iOS, a "toggle" to switch between the two settings. Maybe change the background color to distinguish between the two settings.
* Make the application persist AKA have the app remember the last age inputted upon application re-starts
