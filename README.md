# iOS Beginner Workshops, Fall 2016

**PRO TIP:** There's a shorter URL to get to this repo -> [txcsmad.com/go/ios](http://txcsmad.com/go/ios) 

## Course Structure

* [Workshops](https://www.txcsmad.com/workshops/) on Thursdays from 6:30 - 8:00 PM
  * Kickstart a weekly application as a class and learn different mobile development and iOS concepts weekly. 
* Stretches 
  * Stretch (noun) - An optional goal or challenge that we challenge you to complete on your own time. Each stretch will build upon that week's workshop application, emphasizing concepts learned in workshop and encouraging you to explore new concepts independently.
  * Stretches are used for EXTRA practice and are NOT mandatory.
  * We will post a list of stretches weekly on workshop Facebook pages and Github repos.
* Office Hours
  * Date and Time TBD
  * Let us help you! Come talk to us about projects, stretches, missed workshops, etc.

## Resources

* [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) - A collection of resources on the Swift programming language published by non other than Apple itself.

## What should I do if I miss a workshop?

Not to worry! All the materials used in the workshop (Including the starting and ending state of whatever we worked on) are neatly organized in the folders in this repo. The READMEs in each folder will briefly describe what we did during the workshop so you can get a grasp of what was covered.
